If you're getting "Invalid credentials" error, here's the fix:

2. Seed the database (this creates all users):
   cd server
   node seed-mongodb.js

3. Start the servers:
   Terminal 1: cd server && node index-mongodb.js
   Terminal 2: npm run dev

📖 FULL INSTRUCTIONS:
Read SETUP.md file - it has everything step by step!

🔑 LOGIN CREDENTIALS (after seeding):
Email: superadmin@payzenix.com
Password: admin123

Other accounts:
- admin@payzenix.com / admin123
